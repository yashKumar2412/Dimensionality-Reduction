# Dimensionality-Reduction
As part of my Data Mining coursework, I have created this assignment repository to display my work on advanced dimensionality reduction techniques on a variety of datasets.

The colabs/notebooks linked are as follows:
1. [Dimensionality Reduction](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TdPH-7jHsndWj3iVmwL7wwMDXnTqD425?usp=sharing) techniques applied on tabular data using [Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data).
2. [Dimensionality Reduction](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BgWpQvAWYrvDqAN8AFspTKWmulpjLyeC?usp=sharing) techniques applied on image data using [Labelled Faces in the Wild Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atulanandjha/lfwpeople).
3. [Dimensionality Reduction]() techniques applied using Databricks.
